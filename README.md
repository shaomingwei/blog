# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To install this theme, jekyll is required to be installed on your system. Head over to the [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and install the four requirements (Ruby, RubyGems, Node.js and Python 2.7). If you're on a Mac system, it's likely the only package you'll need to install is Node.js

Once you've installed the requirements, run this command in your terminal:

```
$ sudo gem install jekyll
```

You'll also need to install the bundler package:

```
$ sudo gem install bundler
```

## Downloading and Installing the theme

Download the theme

```
https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-architect-theme/archive/master.zip
```

Unzip it and use it as a regular jekyll folder.

```
$ unzip jekyll-architect-theme-master.zip
```

Get inside the newly extracted folder

```
$ cd jekyll-architect-theme-master
```

Install the dependencies

```
$ bundle install
```

Use it!

```
$ jekyll serve
```

# Setup

Some important configuration can be done in the file `_config.yml`. Please, check the Setup section in that file.


## baseurl

`baseurl` parameter is required in the case the site doesn't sit on the root of the domain. For example: https://pietromenna.github.io/jekyll-architect-theme

In the case above the baseurl should be set to "/jekyll-architect-theme".

In the case the site sits in the root, you can leave `baseurl` as empty "".


For more details read about [Jekyll][1] on its web page.
